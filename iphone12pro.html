    <p>The iPhone 12 Pro is here, and after living with it for a fairly decent amount of time, I think it's time to answer that one burning question — is it worth it? Apple has made choosing between iPhone models even tougher this year by introducing four new models, all sharing similar specifications and features, but at vastly different prices. In India, especially, the price difference between the iPhone 12 series and the iPhone 12 Pro series is massive – and that's a whole separate discussion.</p>
